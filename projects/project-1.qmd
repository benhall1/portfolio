<span class="section-label">The Problem</span>

## Why I Built This

As a college student, I constantly face the challenge of having too much to read and not enough time. Textbooks, research papers, articles, and course materials pile up quickly. Traditional reading methods are inefficient—most people read at roughly the same speed they did in elementary school.

<span class="section-label">The Solution</span>

## How Readzy Works

Readzy addresses this by using proven speed reading techniques in a digital format. By controlling how text is presented to the user, the app helps readers break free from subvocalization and other habits that slow down reading.

**Key Features:**

- Presents text in optimized chunks for faster processing
- Adjustable reading speed to match your comfort level
- Clean, distraction-free interface
- Works with any text you paste in

## What I Learned

Building Readzy taught me how to rapidly prototype and ship a working product using AI-assisted development. The entire project—from idea to deployed application—was completed in a fraction of the time traditional development would have taken.

This experience reinforced my belief that the tools we use to build matter almost as much as what we build. Claude Code allowed me to focus on the product and user experience rather than getting stuck on implementation details.
