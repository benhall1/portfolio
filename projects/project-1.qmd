## Overview

Readzy is a speed reading application designed to help users consume written content faster while maintaining comprehension. Built using Claude Code and deployed on Vercel, this project demonstrates how AI-assisted development can accelerate the creation of useful tools.

The primary purpose of this app is to:

- Help users read faster by presenting text in optimized chunks
- Improve reading comprehension through focused attention techniques
- Save time for students, professionals, and anyone who needs to process large amounts of text

## The Problem

As a college student, I constantly face the challenge of having too much to read and not enough time. Textbooks, research papers, articles, and course materials pile up quickly. Traditional reading methods are inefficient, and most people read at roughly the same speed they did in elementary school.

## The Solution

Readzy addresses this by using proven speed reading techniques in a digital format. By controlling how text is presented to the user, the app helps readers break free from subvocalization and other habits that slow down reading.
