## Background

I'm a senior at Brigham Young University studying Entrepreneurial Management. I'm passionate about building products that solve real problems and make people's lives more efficient. My recent project, Readzy, reflects my belief that small improvements in how we learn can have massive compound effects over time.

### Education

- **B.S. Entrepreneurial Management**, Brigham Young University (Expected 2025)
- **Relevant Coursework**: Product Management, Business Strategy, Digital Product Development
- **Focus Areas**: Product development, startup strategy, technology entrepreneurship

### Skills & Interests

**Technical Skills**

- AI-assisted development with Claude Code
- Web development and deployment (Vercel, GitHub Pages)
- Product prototyping and MVP development

**Product Skills**

- Problem discovery and validation
- User research and feedback analysis
- Agile development practices

**Interests**

Outside of school, I'm interested in reading, personal productivity, and exploring new technologies. I believe in continuous learning and finding ways to do more with less.

### What's Next

I'm looking for opportunities where I can apply my entrepreneurial mindset and product development skills. I'm particularly interested in roles that let me work at the intersection of technology and business, whether that's at a startup, in product management, or building something of my own.
