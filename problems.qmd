title: "Problems I'm Exploring"
---

As an aspiring product manager and entrepreneur, I believe great products start with deeply understanding problems worth solving. Here are five problems I personally experience and think deserve better solutions.

## 1. Reading Speed & Comprehension

**The Problem:** Students and professionals are expected to consume massive amounts of information, but traditional reading methods are slow and inefficient. The average person reads at about 200-300 words per minute, a rate that hasn't improved much since elementary school.

**Why It Matters to Me:** As a college student with textbooks, research papers, and articles constantly piling up, I've felt the pain of not having enough time to read everything I need to. Time is our most limited resource, and better reading skills could unlock significantly more learning in less time.

**Worth Solving Because:** If we could help people read 2-3x faster with maintained comprehension, we'd essentially give them extra hours in their day. The compound effects of faster learning are enormous.

## 2. Validating Business Ideas Quickly

**The Problem:** Aspiring entrepreneurs often spend months building products that nobody wants. The traditional approach of "build it and they will come" leads to wasted time, money, and motivation.

**Why It Matters to Me:** As an Entrepreneurial Management student, I've seen classmates (and experienced myself) the frustration of building something only to discover there's no real demand. Getting fast, honest feedback before investing significant resources is crucial.

**Worth Solving Because:** Faster validation means more entrepreneurs can find product-market fit sooner, or pivot before burning out. This could dramatically increase the success rate of new ventures.

## 3. Finding the Right Co-founders & Team Members

**The Problem:** Great ideas often fail because the founding team isn't right. Finding collaborators with complementary skills, aligned values, and compatible working styles is incredibly difficult, especially for students without extensive professional networks.

**Why It Matters to Me:** I've had project ideas I couldn't pursue because I lacked the technical skills or simply didn't know the right people to work with. The people you build with matter as much as what you build.

**Worth Solving Because:** If we could better match potential co-founders based on skills, goals, and compatibility, we might see more successful startups and fewer team-related failures.

## 4. Managing Multiple Priorities Without Burnout

**The Problem:** Balancing coursework, side projects, part-time work, relationships, and personal health creates constant tension. Deciding what to focus on each day can be paralyzing, and the fear of missing out on opportunities leads to overcommitment.

**Why It Matters to Me:** As a senior juggling graduation requirements, job applications, and personal projects, I regularly feel the stress of too many competing priorities. Traditional to-do lists don't capture the complexity of real tradeoffs.

**Worth Solving Because:** Better systems for managing competing priorities could reduce stress, prevent burnout, and help people make progress on what actually matters to them.

## 5. Staying Current in Fast-Moving Fields

**The Problem:** Technology and business trends change rapidly. Keeping up with industry news, new tools, and emerging best practices without drowning in information overload requires better systems than most people have.

**Why It Matters to Me:** The skills that matter today might be obsolete in a few years. I want to stay ahead of the curve, but the volume of content (newsletters, podcasts, articles, social media) is overwhelming.

**Worth Solving Because:** Curated, personalized learning paths that surface the most relevant information for someone's specific goals could help people learn more effectively and stay competitive in their careers.
